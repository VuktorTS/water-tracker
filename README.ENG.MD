WaterTracker is a project aimed at creating an application for tracking water
consumption, which serves as a tool for monitoring and managing daily water
intake. Key Features include a user profile where users set goals for daily
water intake, add and edit consumed water portions, and receive visual
representations of their daily and monthly water consumption data.
